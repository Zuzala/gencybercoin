                <p class="lead">Cryptocurrency (digital currency) is booming. It is a type of currency that does not need any bank to operate (for example, Bitcoin). In fact, all transactions happen online, most of the times anonymously. One of the most important security topics called <i>cryptography</i> made cryptocurrency possible. Cryptocurrency preserves security and privacy of every user.</p>
                <p class="lead">To learn more about cryptography, check out an <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXCTbFnK8o&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&index=35&t=0s" target="_blank">awesome 12-min video</a></u>.</p>
                <p class="lead">GenCyberCoin was developed with a purpose of demonstrating that cryptocurrency can be used to receive rewards that later can be redeemed to perform money transactions and even purchase real goods. Also, you can get rewarded for finding bugs on this website (check out Bug Bounty) and answering Reconnaissance questions.</p>
                <p class="lead">Watch a <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9jOJk30eQs" target="_blank">5-min video</a></u> to learn how Bitcoin works.</p>

            <h2 class="intro-text text-center">GenCyberCoin Market</h2>
            <hr>
            <div class="normal-text">
                <p class="lead">In the real world, the cryptocurrency market value is very unstable and can change drastically from hour to hour. For instance, one day you can get $10,000 for one Bitcoin, and the following day $11,000 or the other way around - $9,000.</p>
                <p class="lead">In order to make it more realistic for the market goods on the GenCyberCoin website, the cost of every item will vary depending on how many GenCyberCoins every user owns and how many items have been bought. So, keep an eye on the price tag when the time comes to purchasing the goods from the market. If you added something in your cart based on one price, it may change right there next time you see it. Go to your market page, maybe the price is already changed!</p>
